## 📊 Character Count Distribution

| Length Range | Count | Percentage | Files |
|-------------|-------|------------|-------|
| 1-100 chars | 1 | 11.1% | Minimal (69) |
| 101-300 chars | 1 | 11.1% | Bullet Point (250) |
| 301-500 chars | 5 | 55.6% | Junior Dev (332), Project Based (371), Traditional (495), Complex (483), Narrative (493) |
| 501-700 chars | 0 | 0% | None |
| 701+ chars | 2 | 22.2% | Full Stack (735), Data Scientist (879) |

## 🔧 How Character Counts Are Calculated

```python
def calculate_character_count(text: str) -> int:
    """
    Calculate total character count including:
    - Letters (A-Z, a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9) 
    - Spaces
    - Special characters (•, -, :, @, etc.)
    - Newlines (\n)
    - Punctuation (., !, ?, etc.)
    """
    return len(text)

# Example:
resume_text = "Skills: Python, SQL"
count = len(resume_text)  # Returns 18
# S-k-i-l-l-s-:-SPACE-P-y-t-h-o-n-,-SPACE-S-Q-L
```

## 🎯 Usage in Agent 1 Testing

These samples are used to test:

1. **Format Recognition**: Agent 1's ability to extract skills from different resume structures
2. **Skill Extraction Accuracy**: Comparing extracted vs expected skills
3. **Length Handling**: Performance across different resume lengths
4. **Integration Testing**: Data flow from Agent 1 to Agent 2
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Regex-based extraction when AI parsing fails

## 📋 Quick Reference

**Shortest Resume**: 69 characters (Minimal format)  
**Longest Resume**: 879 characters (Senior Data Scientist)  
**Average Length**: 456 characters  
**Most Common Range**: 300-500 characters (55.6% of samples)  
**Total Test Data**: 4,107 characters across 9 files

## 🛠️ Verification Tools

- `calculate_lengths.py` - Calculates and displays all file lengths
- `verify_counts.py` - Verifies character count methodology
- All character counts verified with Python's `len()` function
