# 🔗 Data Integration Guide: AI Agents + Curated Data

## 📋 Overview
The AI agents have been successfully integrated with Nishant's curated data files (`job_roles.json` and `courses.json`) to provide more accurate and consistent career guidance.

## 🗂️ Data Files Integration

### 📊 job_roles.json
- **Location**: `/data/job_roles.json`
- **Purpose**: Defines required skills for each career path
- **Content**: 6 career paths with 14-15 skills each
- **Integration**: Used by Agent 2 (Gap Analyzer) for accurate skill gap analysis

### 📚 courses.json  
- **Location**: `/data/courses.json`
- **Purpose**: Maps skills to specific course recommendations
- **Content**: 72 skills with 4 course recommendations each (288 total courses)
- **Integration**: Used by Agent 3 (Roadmap Mentor) for specific course suggestions

## 🤖 Agent Enhancements

### Agent 1: Skill Extractor
- **Status**: No changes needed
- **Function**: Still extracts skills from user input using NLP

### Agent 2: Gap Analyzer ✅ Enhanced
**Before**: Used AI knowledge only for skill gap analysis  
**After**: Uses curated job requirements for precise gap analysis

```python
# New functionality:
required_skills = JOB_ROLES_DATA.get(target_role, [])
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent skill requirements across all users
- ✅ Accurate gap analysis based on industry standards
- ✅ Reliable missing skills identification

### Agent 3: Roadmap Mentor ✅ Enhanced  
**Before**: Generated generic course recommendations using AI  
**After**: Uses curated course database with fallback to AI

```python
# New functionality:
curated_courses_info = get_courses_for_skill(skill)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Vetted course recommendations from trusted platforms
- ✅ Consistent course quality across recommendations
- ✅ Mix of free and paid resources (70% free)

## 🚀 New Utility Functions

### Available Career Paths
```python
career_paths = get_available_career_paths()
# Returns: ['Data Scientist', 'Full Stack Web Developer', ...]
```

### Skills for Role
```python
skills = get_skills_for_role("Data Scientist")
# Returns: ['Python', 'SQL', 'Pandas', 'NumPy', ...]
```

### Courses for Skill
```python
courses = get_courses_for_skill("Python")
# Returns: ['Python for Everybody - Coursera', ...]
```

## 📈 Integration Benefits

### 🎯 Accuracy Improvements
- **Before**: AI-generated skill lists (variable quality)
- **After**: Industry-validated skill requirements (consistent)

### 📚 Course Quality
- **Before**: Generic AI course suggestions
- **After**: Curated courses from trusted platforms:
  - 48.6% YouTube (free tutorials)
  - 30.2% Other platforms (documentation, books)
  - 12.8% IBM SkillsBuild (free professional courses)
  - 6.2% Coursera (university courses)
  - 2.1% freeCodeCamp (free coding bootcamp)

### 🔄 Consistency
- **Before**: Different recommendations for same role
- **After**: Standardized recommendations across all users

## 💻 Code Changes Summary

### 1. Data Loading
```python
# Added global data loading
JOB_ROLES_DATA, COURSES_DATA = load_data_files()
```

### 2. Enhanced Gap Analysis
```python
# Agent 2 now uses curated job requirements
required_skills = JOB_ROLES_DATA.get(target_role, [])
```

### 3. Enhanced Course Recommendations  
```python
# Agent 3 now uses curated course database
curated_courses_info = get_courses_for_skill(skill)
```

### 4. New Helper Functions
- `get_available_career_paths()`
- `get_skills_for_role(role)`
- `get_courses_for_skill(skill)`

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### Run Integration Test
```bash
cd ai-agents
python test_data_integration.py
```

### Expected Output
- ✅ 6 career paths loaded
- ✅ 72 skills with course recommendations  
- ✅ Smart skill matching with case-insensitive lookup
- ✅ Platform distribution analysis

### Run Full Pipeline (requires API keys)
```bash
cd ai-agents  
python career_pathfinder_langgraph.py
```

## 🔧 Fallback Behavior

### If Data Files Missing
- System gracefully falls back to AI-only mode
- Displays warning: "⚠️ Curated data files not found, using AI-only mode"
- All functionality remains available

### If Skill Not Found in Courses
- Uses AI to generate course recommendations
- Maintains system reliability
- Logs the fallback for improvement

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Backend Integration (M1)
```python
from ai_agents.career_pathfinder_langgraph import get_available_career_paths, get_skills_for_role

# Get all career paths for dropdown
paths = get_available_career_paths()

# Get skills for selected role
skills = get_skills_for_role("Data Scientist")
```

### Frontend Integration (M3)
```javascript
// The JSON output now includes curated course information
{
  "roadmap": [
    {
      "phase": "Phase 1: Foundation",
      "skills": [
        {
          "skill": "Python",
          "course": "Python for Everybody - Coursera",
          "platform": "Coursera",
          "reason": "Comprehensive beginner course"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Data Quality Metrics
