# Agent 1 Output → Agent 2 Input
extracted_skills = ["python", "react", "sql", "git"]
target_role = "Data Scientist"

# Agent 2 uses curated job_roles.json
required_skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Pandas", "NumPy", ...]
missing_skills = [skill for skill in required if skill not in extracted]
```

### Benefits of Integration
- ✅ **Consistent Gap Analysis**: Uses standardized skill names
- ✅ **Accurate Course Mapping**: Enables precise course recommendations
- ✅ **Role Compatibility**: Works with all 6 curated career paths
- ✅ **Quality Assurance**: Validated against industry-standard skill lists
