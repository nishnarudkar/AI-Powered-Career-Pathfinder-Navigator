## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Role Readiness Agent
```python
class RoleReadinessAgent:
    def assess_role_readiness(self, user_skills):
        # Multi-role assessment
        
    def assess_single_role_readiness(self, user_skills, target_role):
        # Single role assessment
        
    def assess_single_role_from_raw_skills(self, skills_text, target_role):
        # Assessment from raw skill text
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /assess-role-readiness` - Multi-role assessment
- `POST /assess-target-role-readiness` - Single role assessment

### Frontend Workflow

#### New User Experience Flow
1. **Skill Input**: User adds skills manually or via resume extraction
2. **Role Selection**: User selects target role from dropdown
3. **Automatic Assessment**: Role readiness appears immediately
4. **Roadmap Generation**: Generate button becomes enabled

#### Previous vs Current Workflow
| Previous | Current |
|----------|---------|
| Skills → Assess All Roles → Select Role → Generate Roadmap | Skills → Select Role → Assess Target Role → Generate Roadmap |
| General assessment for all roles | Focused assessment for selected role only |
| User overwhelm with multiple options | Clean, focused interface |

### Single Role Assessment
```javascript
// Frontend request
const response = await fetch('/assess-target-role-readiness', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        skills: ['Python', 'SQL', 'Statistics'],
        target_role: 'data-scientist'
    })
});

const result = await response.json();
// Returns focused assessment for data scientist role only
```

### Multi-Role Assessment
```javascript
// For comparison or initial exploration
const response = await fetch('/assess-role-readiness', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
